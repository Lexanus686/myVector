# myVector
This is a ReadME of Vector project

Python v3.7

Current abilities:
  <li>All possible mathematical operations with vectors (+, -, etc.)</li>
  <li>Calculating their normalized form and their projections on axises</li>
  <li>Rotating, reversing and inlining our vectors</li>
  <li>Basic operations with file (write, read)</li>

In project therefore goes Unit tests, covering all basic functions

Versions:
  <li>v1.3: Adding new Unit tests, covering critical moments of code with exceptions</li>
  <li>v1.2: Determening reverse functions: reversing direction, xAxis and yAxis of vector</li>
  <li>v1.1: Releasing vector reading from file and writing in it, optimising code</li>
  <li>v1.0: Added basic mathematical operations with Point, Vector, working with tuples</li>
